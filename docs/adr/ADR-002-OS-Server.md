# ADR-002: Choose Debian as the Operating System for Server

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2024-09-13

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to select an operating system for our servers that offers stability, security, and a strong package management system. The operating system should be compatible with our existing tools and provide long-term support.

## Solution (Decision)
We will use Debian as the operating system for our servers. Debian is known for its stability, security, and extensive repository of packages. It has a long-term support policy, making it suitable for a reliable and secure server environment.

## Alternatives
- **Ubuntu Server**: Considered for its ease of use and regular updates, but Debian was chosen for its slightly longer release cycles and perceived stability in a production environment.
- **CentOS**: Considered for its enterprise-level stability and compatibility with Red Hat, but Debian was preferred due to its broader package repository and longer support cycle.

## Comparison Table
| Feature/Criteria          | Debian                   | Ubuntu Server            | CentOS                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Stability**             | High                     | High                     | High                           |
| **Release Cycle**         | Longer (2 years)         | Shorter (6 months)       | Rolling (CentOS Stream)        |
| **EOL**                   | 5 years for LTS          | 5 years for LTS versions | Rolling for CentOS Stream      |
| **Package Repository**    | Extensive                | Extensive                | More limited                   |
| **Support**               | Long-term support (LTS)  | Regular and LTS versions | Long-term support (CentOS 7)   |
| **Community Support**     | Strong                   | Strong                   | Strong                         |
| **Compatibility**         | Broad                    | Broad                    | Limited to Red Hat-based tools |

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Debian provides a stable and secure environment with a strong focus on long-term support. Its extensive package repository and community support make it a robust choice for server operations.
- **Negative**: The release cycle is longer compared to Ubuntu, which might delay access to newer features and updates.
