## Status

## Context and Problem Statement
We need to select a hypervisor for our home lab that offers robust virtualization capabilities, efficient management, and reliable backup options. The solution should be open-source and supported by a strong community, with a management tool that enhances these features.

## Solution (Decision)
We will use XCP-ng as the hypervisor and Xen Orchestra as the management tool for our home lab. XCP-ng is an open-source virtualization platform with strong performance and scalability. Xen Orchestra complements XCP-ng by providing a comprehensive web-based management interface with advanced backup, snapshot, and restoration features.

## Alternatives
- **Proxmox VE**: Considered for its integrated container management and backup solutions, but XCP-ng with Xen Orchestra was chosen for its robust virtualization features, advanced management capabilities, and comprehensive backup and restoration options.
- **VMware ESXi**: Known for its enterprise features but involves licensing costs and requires third-party backup solutions, making it less ideal for a home lab environment.

## Comparison Table
| Feature/Criteria          | XCP-ng with Xen Orchestra | Proxmox VE              | VMware ESXi             |
|---------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Virtualization**        | KVM, Xen                  | KVM, LXC                | KVM                     |
| **Container Management**  | No                        | Yes                     | No                      |
| **Web Interface**         | Yes (Xen Orchestra)        | Yes                     | Yes                     |
| **High Availability**     | Yes                       | Yes                     | Yes                     |
| **Licensing Cost**        | Free                      | Free                    | Paid                    |
| **Community Support**     | Strong                    | Strong                  | Strong                  |
| **Backup and Snapshots**  | Advanced backup tools (Xen Orchestra), supports third-party solutions | Built-in backup tools, supports third-party solutions | Requires third-party backup solutions |

## Consequences
- **Positive**: Combining XCP-ng with Xen Orchestra provides a powerful and cost-effective virtualization solution with an advanced management interface and robust backup features. This setup leverages the strengths of both tools and ensures a reliable and scalable platform for managing virtual machines.
- **Negative**: There will be a learning curve associated with using both XCP-ng and Xen Orchestra, and integrating them into existing workflows may require adjustments.
