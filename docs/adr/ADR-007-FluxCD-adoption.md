## Context and Problem Statement

I need a reliable tool for managing Continuous Deployment (CD) and applying GitOps principles to my Kubernetes clusters. The tool should align well with my GitOps workflow, support Kubernetes-native integrations, and allow me to manage both infrastructure and applications declaratively.

## Solution (Decision)

I have chosen **FluxCD** as the primary tool to manage Kubernetes cluster configurations and application deployments. FluxCD offers a lightweight, GitOps-first approach, making it easy to continuously reconcile the desired state of my clusters based on the configuration stored in Git.

### Key Advantages of FluxCD

- **GitOps-Centric**: FluxCD strictly adheres to GitOps principles, continuously ensuring the cluster matches the desired state defined in Git.
- **Lightweight**: No need for additional UI or API server components, which reduces resource overhead.
- **Native Support for Helm & Kustomize**: Seamless integration with Helm charts and Kustomize overlays, which I already use in my repository.
- **Infrastructure and Application Management**: FluxCD can manage both infrastructure components and applications in the same workflow.

## Alternatives

1. **Argo CD**:
   - Provides a richer feature set, including a web-based UI and more control over synchronization and deployments.
   - However, Argo CD is more resource-intensive, and the focus on UI-driven management is unnecessary for my current setup.

2. **Jenkins X**:
   - Jenkins X is an advanced CI/CD tool but focuses heavily on CI workflows, which aren't a primary requirement for my setup. It also introduces unnecessary complexity and resource usage.

## Comparison Table

| Feature/Criteria             | FluxCD                        | Argo CD                          | Jenkins X                         |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **GitOps Focus**             | Strong GitOps principles      | GitOps but with added UI control | Primarily focused on CI/CD     |
| **Resource Usage**           | Low                           | Medium (UI/API overhead)         | High                           |
| **Deployment Strategies**    | Supports Helm/Kustomize       | Advanced (hooks, waves, etc.)    | Complex, focuses more on CI    |
| **Multi-tenancy Support**    | Available with setup          | Strong native support            | Available but not as mature    |
| **Ease of Use**              | Simple Git-based workflows    | UI-driven, more flexible         | High complexity                |

## Consequences

- **Positive**:
  - Streamlined GitOps workflow with a lightweight, resource-efficient tool.
  - Easy integration with my existing infrastructure and Kubernetes cluster management.
  - FluxCDâ€™s Git-centric approach keeps the configuration declarative and easily auditable.
  
- **Negative**:
  - Lack of a built-in web UI could be a drawback for those who prefer visual interfaces for managing applications.
  - Multi-tenancy and RBAC may require additional configuration compared to other tools like Argo CD.
