# create a self-signed Certificate Authority (CA) certificate using cert-manager.
# This can be useful if you want to generate a root CA certificate that can sign other certificates within the cluster.
# Purpose of the Certificate
# - The Certificate resource creates a CA (Certificate Authority) certificate, which can be used to sign other certificates (e.g., TLS certificates for services like Traefik).
# - The isCA: true field indicates that this certificate is intended to be used as a CA.
# - The resulting certificate will be stored in a Kubernetes secret (selfsigned-secret), and it can later be used by other certificates that require a CA.
